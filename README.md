# Implicit Spatial Relationship Learning with Energy-Based and Diffusion Models

## Project Overview

This project aims to learn implicit spatial relationships between objects in 3D scenes using Energy-Based Models (EBMs) and generate plausible object configurations using Diffusion Models guided by the learned energy function.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Data loading and generation scripts.
- `models/`: Neural network models for the energy function and diffusion process.
- `training/`: Training scripts for the energy model and diffusion model.
- `inference/`: Scripts for generating new scenes.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `main.py`: Entry point for training and inference.
